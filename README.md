Steppe
======

Steppe is a custom HTML5 canvas 2.5D landscape renderer and compositor. The
JavaScript source code for Steppe is unobfuscated and can be used free of
charge in your own projects.

Steppe, like [Fleeting Fantasy](http://fleetingfantasy.com/), is actively under
development so we recommend you wait until it's production-ready before using
it for anything serious.
